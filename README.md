# Used Car Price Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the price of used cars based on various features using a Linear Regression model. The project is part of a Kaggle competition or a case study that involves building a machine learning model to predict the prices of used cars given their specifications and historical data. The final model provides accurate price predictions which can help both car sellers and buyers.

## Features

The dataset includes the following features (may vary depending on the actual dataset used):

- `Year` – Year the car was manufactured
- `Mileage` – Distance traveled by the car
- `Engine Size` – Size of the engine (in cc)
- `Fuel Type` – Type of fuel used by the car
- `Transmission` – Type of transmission (automatic or manual)
- `Owner Type` – Whether the car has been owned previously or is a new car
- `Brand` – Brand or manufacturer of the car
- `Model` – Model of the car
- `Price` – Price of the used car (Target Variable)

## Problem Statement

The goal is to develop a regression model to accurately predict the price of a used car based on its attributes.

## Model

The solution uses a **Linear Regression** model to capture the relationships between the car attributes and its price. Linear regression is a statistical approach that models the relationship between a dependent variable (Price) and one or more independent variables (features such as Year, Mileage, Engine Size, etc.).

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (you can provide the specific dataset link here).
   
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Scaling numerical features
   - Feature selection

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Correlation analysis
   - Visualization of feature distributions
   - Outlier detection and removal

4. **Modeling**:
   - Train-Test Split: The dataset was split into training and testing sets.
   - Linear Regression model training using the training set.
   - Hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's performance.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model on the test set using metrics such as:
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
     - R-squared Score
   - Cross-validation was used to ensure the model's robustness.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/used-car-price-prediction.git
   cd used-car-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CarPricePrediction.ipynb
   ```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

## Results

The final model achieved the following performance:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: *your MAE score*
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: *your MSE score*
- **R-squared Score**: *your R-squared score*

## Future Work

Possible improvements include:

- Trying other regression algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.
- Further feature engineering, such as adding interaction terms between variables.
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
- Deploying the model using Flask/Django or creating a web app for user interaction.
